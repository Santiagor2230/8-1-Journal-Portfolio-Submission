## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial consultant buisness which purpose is to develop individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their sponsors. The client is Artemis Financial and the issues they desired to fix is to updated their operations in order for their system to be current and in order to succeed in implementing their software, they required the neccesary software security that will allow for their new software to be secure. 

## What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

I feel that what I did really well in identifying their sofware security vunerability is analyzing the dependency check which allow a deeper understanding on major issues that the system might have so understanding the devependcy check was my strongest skill. It is important to code securely because security will always be important specially if we are implementing a new software that is going into the system we will most likely want the system to be protect from any attacks that are outside or even inside the company. The value that a software security adds to a company overall wellbeing is reliability because it will insure that most customer will feel that their system will protect their sensetive information and that is what makes a compnay stand out is making sure that their customers feels safe with the buisness. 

## What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

The process of working through the vunerability assessment was very helpfull because it was much more easier to identify most vunerability through the steps and software such as the dependecy check which allows a faster and more realiable way to find the vunerabilities that the software might have and overall protect it better within layers of secrutiy.

## How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

I approach the need to increase layers of security by going through steps that secured the system and which will be technicques that I will use for future project and these steps are to first of impementi a checksum which insures that the hash is secure, then we apply a dependecy check to understand the overal vuenebralities that are hard to find. Than since we are securing a wesbite we apply the certification to make sure that the web browser is secure with the HTTPS protocol and finally we manually check for any vunerabilities that we might find that are logical and knowing these layers are important because at the end of the day the software is much more secure and its easier to find a mitigation.

## How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I ensure that the code and software application were functional and secure by constantly looking into the dependency check and running the code for any errors that might popped up while implementing new things. After refactoring code, I check to see if I introduced new vulnerabilities by constantly checking into the dependency reports that give more of an understanding on additional vunerabilities that might have been added through the process.

## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

For future assignments or task the tools that I will use for security methods will be ofcourse the dependency check which was a reliable vunerability report that aid me with most of the issues as long as they werent false positive, a tool called deepsource that also helped with logical vunerbailties that I had not detected and finally understanding the vunerability assessment process flow chart which basically illustrated a step by step understanding of all vunebrailities that need to be taken into consideration.

## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

To future employer I will want to address my ability of implementing a certification for a website and ofcourse my full understanding on how to read the dependency check report which is something that is usefull for future jobs I might have.
